                We can't actually predict the weather 20+ years in advance (shocking, we know), and we definitely won't be taking your money.

                But hey, since you're here reading a privacy policy for a fictional insurance product, we might as well have some fun with it!

                    We do make real API calls to Open-Meteo to get historical weather data. This is probably the only real thing on this entire site! 
                    We use this data to calculate hilariously specific insurance premiums for golf days that happened 30 years ago.

                    <strong>Fun fact:</strong> We can tell you if it was raining in Ballybunion on March 15, 1987 at 2 PM. 
                    Why? Because we can, and it's surprisingly entertaining.

                    We don't use cookies. Not because we're privacy champions, but because this is a simple demo and we were too lazy to implement them. 
                    Your browser might store some stuff locally because that's what browsers do, but we're not involved in that relationship.
